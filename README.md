#  Employee Directory ![employee-directory-react](https://img.shields.io/github/license/sbolotnikov/employee-directory-react)
## Description 
### Overview
This project creates a employee directory with React. It requires to break up application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.
Using faker.js I get a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

### User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees 
by name, date of birth, email, phone number and sort the table by at 4 different categories
